# SD-Card Font Cache

The inactive OTA application slot doubles as a disposable cache for one SD-card
reader font. This removes most filesystem and SD-SPI latency from the reader's
initial font load, first-page prewarm, later page prewarms, and on-demand glyph
reads.

The cache holds only the selected reader family and point size. It does not
cache the 8/10/12pt UI fallback fonts, add an LRU, or make an SD font part of
the firmware image. `SdCardFont` still provides the renderer-facing font
interface; only its random-access storage backend changes.

On `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` targets, the selected reader font also gets a volatile,
1 MiB on-demand glyph cache. The first metadata or bitmap read still comes from
the selected Flash/SD backend; later pages copy the same immutable glyph bytes
from PSRAM into the ordinary internal-DRAM page mini-cache. The PSRAM cache is
released with the font, is never used by UI fallback sizes, and does not change
the persistent cache format. Allocation failure leaves the existing Flash/SD
path unchanged.

On no-PSRAM targets, optional advance-table and page prewarm allocations must
leave 16 KiB free heap and 8 KiB contiguous headroom. Their budgets include
simultaneously live collection, mapping, staging and replacement buffers; old
caches are already charged against the live heap. A rejected prewarm keeps
on-demand font reads available and is not reported as missing glyph coverage.
Page cache growth acquires all replacement buffers before discarding valid data;
temporary mappings remain RAII-owned on every exit. The no-PSRAM preparation
path does not run the PSRAM path's later capacity-growth checks. Its budget
pre-read uses one stack glyph instead of another heap array of glyph metadata.
Between chapter parsing batches, the reader releases rebuildable font caches
when free heap is below 48 KiB or the largest block is below 16 KiB.

The canonical byte layout is documented in
[file-formats.md](../file-formats.md#sd-card-font-cache).

## Partition reuse model

CrossPoint keeps two interchangeable OTA application slots. At any point one
contains the running firmware; `HalOtaSlot::inactive()` selects the other. The
following diagram is one snapshot of those roles, not a fixed assignment:

```text
ESP32 Flash
+-----------------------------------+
| Bootloader / Partition Table      |
+-----------------------------------+
| NVS                               |
+-----------------------------------+
| OTA metadata                      |  cache never writes here
+===================================+
| OTA App Slot A                    |  running firmware
+===================================+
| OTA App Slot B                    |  inactive -> SD font cache
| +-------------------------------+ |
| | Cache header                  | |  Magic/path/size/hash/CRC
| +-------------------------------+ |
| | Current .cpfont payload       | |  bounded random Flash reads
| +-------------------------------+ |
+===================================+
| SPIFFS                            |  not used by this cache
+-----------------------------------+
| Core dump                         |
+-----------------------------------+
```

The cache uses the partition layout as follows:

1. `HalOtaSlot::inactive()` locates the application slot that is not running.
2. `safeForScratchWrite()` permits erasing it only when the running image is
   confirmed or not rollback-tracked; pending and unsafe images are rejected.
3. Preprocessing invalidates the old cache header, writes and verifies the
   `.cpfont` payload, then commits the `CPSDFC1` header and CRC last.
4. `SdCardFont` keeps the same renderer interface while bounded partition reads
   replace SD filesystem reads. A Flash failure retries the same offset on SD.
5. An OTA download overwrites the cache with the new image. After that image is
   confirmed, the former firmware slot becomes inactive and may hold the next
   font cache.

The roles rotate symmetrically in both OTA directions:

```text
Normal boot             First boot after OTA       After confirmation
Slot A: running    ->    Slot A: rollback image ->  Slot A: font cache
Slot B: font cache ->    Slot B: new / pending  ->  Slot B: running
```

`verifyRollbackLater()` prevents Arduino from confirming a pending image before
`setup()`. On the first boot after OTA, the application initializes storage,
settings, the display, the render task, and the font decompressor, then
physically displays the firmware-verification page. Only after that frame
finishes does it mark the running image valid.

Until confirmation succeeds, `safeForScratchWrite()` rejects every cache
write. A reset, crash, watchdog, or power loss before confirmation therefore
still permits bootloader rollback. A power loss while rebuilding after
confirmation leaves the new firmware valid but the cache header invalid, so
the next boot uses SD. Recovery-firmware mode confirms a successfully displayed
new image but skips automatic font rebuilding.

## Why it is faster

An SD font normally pays for SD-SPI transactions, filesystem traversal, and
many seeks while the prewarm code gathers glyph metadata, bitmaps, kerning, and
advance tables. A valid cache preserves the same offset-sorted read algorithm
but serves it with bounded `esp_partition_read()` calls through `HalOtaSlot`.
The font is not memory-mapped, so it does not consume the ESP32-C3's limited
MMU pages.

Startup still opens the SD source long enough to compare its path, size, and
complete-payload CRC identity. The large random reads that dominate page
prewarm then come from internal Flash.

```text
SdCardFont
    |
    v
cache header/path/size/payload CRC valid?
    | yes                         | no
    v                             v
HalOtaSlot bounded random read    HalStorage / SD
    |
    +-- Flash read failure ------> same-offset SD fallback
```

Every Flash read is bounded by the committed payload size, not merely by the
OTA partition capacity. A partition read error disables Flash for that loaded
font and retries the same offset from SD.

## Cache identity and commit

The first 4KiB erase sector contains a versioned `CPSDFC1` header. It records
the source path, payload size, a CRC-32 identity of the complete `.cpfont`
payload, the complete payload CRC-32, and a header CRC-32. The current
0x640000-byte OTA slot leaves 6,549,504 bytes for the `.cpfont` payload.

A preload uses the following commit sequence:

1. Reject an unsafe slot, invalid source, or oversized payload.
2. Allocate one fallible, short-lived 4KiB copy buffer.
3. Erase the header sector first, invalidating any previous cache.
4. Erase and copy the payload while calculating its CRC.
5. Read the payload back from Flash and compare the complete CRC.
6. Write the valid header last.

A partial header write is rejected by its Magic/version/header CRC. The normal
boot path validates the header and SD source identity by rescanning the
complete payload once; this adds a bounded full-font read before the first
page but prevents same-metadata bitmap replacements from reusing stale Flash.
The complete CRC is also guaranteed at commit time, while later
Flash-driver read failures fall back to SD. Silent Flash bit rot after a
successful commit is not detected without rebuilding the cache.

The earlier `CPOTAF1` Magic is intentionally rejected. After a direct USB
flash, that legacy cache falls back to SD until the user confirms the font or
changes its point size. A normal OTA overwrites the cache slot and rebuilds it
after the new firmware is confirmed.

## Rebuild triggers and progress

The hidden `sdFontFlashPreload` setting stores the user's preference:

- Font and point-size changes in Text Settings load only the data needed for
  preview from SD; they do not rebuild the cache.
- On every device, leaving standalone Text Settings by Back or Home offers
  acceleration only when the final SD font family or point size differs from
  the values on entry. Preview changes never write Flash. Layout/style-only
  edits and changes restored before exit retain the original preference.
- The reader toolbar owns one preview session across its font/size pickers,
  panel switches and nested downloads. Only returning to the reading page ends
  that session. Returning to the toolbar alone does not prompt; Home, sleep
  and activity destruction do not start a write. The classic reader menu uses
  the standalone Text Settings flow.
- Both paths check the selected size's `.cpfont` with the read-only
  `SdCardFontCache::preflight()` before asking. A valid cache is enabled and
  reloaded without a prompt or progress page. Built-in and vector fonts skip
  this Flash-cache flow; PSRAM glyph caches and page prewarming are unchanged.
- For an eligible, uncached font, the prompt defaults to **Start acceleration**.
  Not now, Back and outside taps save the selection with acceleration disabled
  and complete the original exit. Reopening the settings without changing the
  font/size does not ask again. Accepting runs the existing progress page and
  returns to the same reading position; the actual preload rechecks eligibility.
- A file exceeding `capacity()` displays a wrapped, button-free notice:
  "Font exceeds acceleration capacity; loading directly from SD card."
  It automatically continues after two seconds measured from the displayed
  frame. The limit concerns the selected `.cpfont` file, not the whole family
  directory or free PSRAM. No progress page, copy buffer, erase or write occurs.
  Other preflight errors show their reason; write failures retain the SD
  fallback acknowledgement. Skips and failures persist acceleration off.
- Downloaded fonts use the same rules. The completion screen reports a ready
  cache only when acceleration is actually enabled. The Chinese missing-glyph
  flow still requires the exact requested NotoSansSC point size and restarts
  after downloading to avoid the Wi-Fi/TLS-fragmented heap. After the clean
  restart it asks before accelerating the selected font, then returns to the
  same book. It does not reuse the already-consented reader preload mode.
- A newly installed OTA image automatically rebuilds once, after successful
  firmware confirmation, when acceleration was previously enabled and the
  selected `.cpfont` has no valid cache. It uses the same preflight, skips the
  confirmation question, and automatically dismisses the oversized notice.
- An ordinary boot does not retry a failed post-OTA rebuild. A later final font
  or point-size change in standalone Text Settings, or an accepted reader
  toolbar prompt after such a change, provides the next explicit retry.
  Entering and leaving Text Settings without such a change is not a retry
  trigger. Sleep, power loss, and forced activity destruction do not start a
  write.

To verify preview decisions and read-only preflight boundaries, build
`ReaderFontPreviewTest` and `SdCardFontPreflightTest`, then run:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build/test -R "ReaderFontPreview|SdCardFontPreflight|FontPreloadFlow" --output-on-failure
```

On a touch device, change an SD font size, return through the toolbar to the page, and decline;
reopening and closing the menu must stay silent. Change again and accept:
the progress page must finish before returning to the same text. Repeat with
physical buttons, a cached size, vector fonts, and changes restored to their
original value. Repeat standalone settings and download/automatic-install
entry points on both C3 and PSRAM devices. An oversized font must show the
notice without buttons and exit automatically; skipped/oversized selections
must never report "cache ready" or erase/write Flash. Check narrow and rotated
screens for complete notice text. Sleep or power loss must not launch a preload.
Serial font statistics should report `source=flash` (or `psram+flash`) after a
successful preload or cache reuse, and `source=sd` (or `psram+sd`) after skipping
an uncached selection. Verify actual Flash writes and power-loss recovery on
hardware, not the desktop simulator.

Manual preloads and post-OTA rebuilds share the same storage-neutral
preprocessing page. It shows the selected family and physical point size,
per-pass byte count, total percentage, and power-loss warning without naming
OTA, copying, or verification.

Internally, copying still occupies total progress 0-50% and read-back
verification occupies 50-100%. The page uses fast refreshes at the pass
transition and 10% increments. Each progress callback waits for its requested
frame to finish before returning to the Flash writer. Progress state is updated under the render lock, which is
released before waiting. This prevents Flash erase/write from suspending the
ReadPico display feeder tasks during a progress refresh. Both entry points
physically complete the
verified 100% frame and the Ready page. Text Settings reloads the final font
afterward so a reader that opened the screen can resume rendering immediately;
post-OTA rebuilds continue to Home without clearing the last-open book or its
reading position.

Automatic sleep and cancellation are disabled during the operation. Failures
are grouped as source too large, OOM, SD read, Flash erase/write, or
verification failure; all continue with the SD font.

During the automatic reader flow, power loss before a font file's verified
rename leaves the previous selection active; `.part` files are never selected.
Power loss after the selection is saved but before the software restart safely
loads the font from SD on the next cold boot and skips automatic preprocessing.
Power loss during preprocessing leaves an invalid cache header, so the selected
font safely loads from SD on the next boot. Failed or cancelled network flows
use a one-shot RTC resume target to avoid reopening the missing-glyph prompt
immediately; a normal cold boot may offer it again.

## Performance verification

An exploratory A/B measurement was run on an X4 with a Chinese SD-card reader
font and EPUB content. One session read the font directly from SD; the other
used the preprocessed internal-Flash cache. Temporary structured timing logs
confirmed `source=sd` and `source=flash` respectively. The SD session supplied
20 render-path prewarm samples and the Flash session supplied 28. Values below
use the median and nearest-rank p95.

| Metric | SD median / p95 | Flash median / p95 | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Font prewarm | 269 / 538 ms | 17 / 32 ms | 93.7% / 94.1% |
| Font read | 257 / 430 ms | 2 / 21 ms | 99.2% / 95.1% |
| Render-path prewarm | 335 / 548 ms | 20 / 35 ms | 94.0% / 93.6% |

For samples with non-zero I/O, the median per-sample `read_ms / io_ops`
dropped from 1.414 ms per operation to 0.063 ms, a 95.5% reduction. The p95 I/O
counts were nearly unchanged (336 from SD and 332 from Flash), so the gain
comes from lower random-read latency rather than doing less font work.

The observed median book-open time fell from 6,626 ms to 2,907 ms, but this is
not treated as an end-to-end acceptance result. Each mode had only two open
samples, the pages were not matched, and grayscale rendering, allocation
failures, and one interleaved serial line contaminated page-total timing. The
measurement therefore supports the font-read and prewarm speedup only.

Existing debug logs expose the storage source and timing needed to repeat the
comparison:

- `Initial load source=flash|sd load_ms=...`
- `[txt-page] source=psram+flash|psram+sd|flash|sd total=... read_ms=...`
- `First page displayed: open_total=...`
- Page rendering logs report display time separately from font prewarm.

A controlled end-to-end rerun must use the same device, SD card, font, point
size, book, and page range in both modes. Disable text antialiasing, avoid image
pages, collect at least five cold book opens and 30 consecutive text pages per
mode, and keep a fixed dwell time when measuring idle prewarm. Report e-paper
refresh separately: the cache accelerates font I/O, not the physical panel
waveform.

The implementation adds no resident cache buffer, background task, or LRU. Its
only new working allocation is the existing 4KiB preload buffer, which is
released immediately after the copy completes or fails.
